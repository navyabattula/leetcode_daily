Products of Array Except Self
Solved 
Given an integer array nums, return an array output where output[i] is the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Each product is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Follow-up: Could you solve it in 
O
(
n
)
O(n) time without using the division operation?

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,4,6]

Output: [48,24,12,8]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,3]

Output: [0,-6,0,0,0]
